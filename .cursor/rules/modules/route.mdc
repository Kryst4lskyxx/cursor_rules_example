# Routing

## Basic Requirements
- Define typed route params and query schemas
- Keep navigation side effects explicit and reversible (back/forward safe)

## Mandatory Actions
- Centralize route names/paths; generate helpers for links
- Guard protected routes; handle unauthorized and not-found states

## Forbidden Behaviors
- Hardcoding paths across components; constructing URLs via string concat

## Example Code
```ts
export const route = { product: (id: string) => `/products/${id}` };
```
