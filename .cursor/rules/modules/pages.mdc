# Pages

## Basic Requirements
- Pages orchestrate data fetching, routing params, and layout composition
- Keep business logic in hooks/services; keep pages thin

## Mandatory Actions
- SSR/SSG/CSR decisions must be explicit with rationale
- Split code by route; lazy-load heavy widgets
- Validate route params and query; handle 404/403/500 gracefully

## Forbidden Behaviors
- Mixing page-level data concerns with low-level component state
- Blocking synchronous calls in route loaders or actions without timeouts

## Example Code
```tsx
export default function ProductPage() { /* compose hooks + components */ }
```
