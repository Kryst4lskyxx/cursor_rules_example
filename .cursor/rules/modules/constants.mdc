# Constants

## Basic Requirements
- Group constants by domain; avoid magic numbers/strings
- Use `as const` for literal unions and enums

## Mandatory Actions
- Prefix env-derived constants clearly; validate at startup
- Document units (ms, s, bytes) in names or comments

## Forbidden Behaviors
- Cross-layer imports that create cycles; mutable exported constants

## Example Code
```ts
export const FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS = 10_000 as const;
```
