# Project Basics

## Basic Requirements
- Standard directories: `src/`, `tests/`, `public/`, `.cursor/rules/`
- Branches: `main` (protected), `develop`, `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `hotfix/*`
- Conventional Commits for messages: `type(scope): summary`
- Provide `.env.example` and a typed config module; never use raw `process.env` outside config
- CI must run build, lint, tests on PRs; no warnings allowed

## Mandatory Actions
- Document decisions in `README` or ADRs; update when behavior or public APIs change
- Keep PRs focused (< 300 lines net diff when possible) and include tests
- Add `CODEOWNERS` for critical paths
- Generate minimal repro and logs for defects; link to issue tracker

## Forbidden Behaviors
- Direct commits to `main`; force-push to shared branches
- Unscoped or ambiguous commits; mixing unrelated changes in one PR
- Non-deterministic builds; missing lockfiles; using machine-specific paths
- Hardcoding secrets/keys; reading envs outside the config layer

## Example Code
```text
feat(routing): add product details route with lazy loading

BREAKING CHANGE: product URL changed to /products/:id
```

```env
# .env.example
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
LOG_LEVEL=info
```
