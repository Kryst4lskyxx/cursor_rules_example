# Commenting Rules

## Basic Requirements
- Write JSDoc for public functions, classes, and React components
- Include file header for modules with purpose, ownership, and key invariants
- Prefer explaining "why" over "what"; keep comments current with code

## Mandatory Actions
- Document side effects, concurrency expectations, and error semantics
- Use TODO only for short-lived follow-ups with an issue link
- Document environment variables in `README` and `.env.example`

## Forbidden Behaviors
- Redundant comments that restate code; outdated or misleading comments
- Large blocks of commented-out code in source files

## Example Code
```ts
/**
 * Parses a price string to a number.
 * - Returns a domain error on invalid input (no throw).
 * - Pure and side-effect free.
 */
export function parsePrice(value: string): Result<number> { /* ... */ }
```
