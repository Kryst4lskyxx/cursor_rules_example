# Logging Workflow

## Basic Requirements
- Use structured logs with level, timestamp, context (requestId, userId, operation)
- Redact PII and secrets; follow data retention policies

## Mandatory Actions
- Log start, success, and failure with durations on critical operations
- Include correlation IDs across services; prefer JSON log format
- Provide logger adapters for browser/node; avoid `console.*` in production

## Forbidden Behaviors
- Logging sensitive data (tokens, passwords, full card numbers)
- Blocking logging I/O on critical paths

## Example Code
```ts
logger.info({ operation: 'fetchProduct', requestId, durationMs }, 'product fetched');
```
